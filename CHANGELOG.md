# Changelog

All notable changes to the Field Navigator project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0-stable] - 2025-08-23

### Added
- **Total Route Distance Display**: Auto-updating distance display showing total route length
- **Distance Calculation**: Sums all route legs for accurate total distance measurement
- **Metric + Imperial Display**: Shows both kilometers and miles (e.g., "2.35 km (1.46 mi)")
- **Distance Chip UI**: Non-intrusive chip in DirectionsToolbar showing total distance
- **Auto-Update Logic**: Distance automatically recalculates when route changes

### Enhanced
- **Robust Directions Rendering**: Comprehensive error handling for all Google Maps DirectionsStatus cases
- **Fresh Points Array Logic**: Removed setTimeout delays, uses immediate fresh array for routing
- **Higher Z-Index**: DirectionsRenderer polyline now renders at z-index 1000 above all overlays
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: HUD now shows directions state (✅ drawn, ❌ no result, —)
- **Environment Logging**: Added Google Maps libraries verification for troubleshooting

### Technical Improvements
- **State Management**: Added totalDistanceMeters state with proper lifecycle management
- **Helper Functions**: computeTotalDistanceMeters and formatDistance for distance handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive DirectionsStatus error messages (REQUEST_DENIED, OVER_QUERY_LIMIT, etc.)
- **Build Optimization**: Clean compilation 599KB JS + 60KB CSS bundle
- **Memory Management**: Proper distance state reset in Clear/Undo operations

### User Experience
- **Complete Workflow**: Set Area → Click A → Click B (route + distance) → Click C (updated route + distance)
- **Visual Feedback**: Distance appears only when route is rendered, disappears when cleared
- **Consistent UI**: Distance chip integrates seamlessly with existing DirectionsToolbar
- **Mobile Ready**: Touch-friendly design with responsive distance display

### Production Ready
- **All Constraints Preserved**: No changes to viewport, rotation, tilt, mask, leash, or mode systems
- **Non-Intrusive**: Distance display doesn't interfere with existing functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: A→B, A→B→C, Clear, Undo, and error scenarios all working
- **Development Server**: Fully functional on localhost:8080

## [0.2.1-hotfix] - 2025-08-21

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug**: State timing issue preventing route point creation in production
- **Root Cause**: Click handler checked `currentMode === 'map'` using old state before React update completed
- **Solution**: Removed redundant state check since mode is known to be 'map' after click inside boundary
- **Impact**: Route setting functionality now works as designed

### Verification
- **Build Successful**: No compilation errors, clean build output
- **User Flow Restored**: Complete workflow from boundary setup to route calculation now functional
- **Production Ready**: Fix ready for deployment

### User Experience
- **Step 1**: Set Map Area → Draw rectangle boundary ✅
- **Step 2**: Click inside boundary → Creates route points A, B, C... ✅ (FIXED)
- **Step 3**: Floating toolbar appears → Clear/Undo/Route controls ✅ 
- **Step 4**: Routes calculate automatically → Walking directions with waypoints ✅

## [0.2.0-stable] - 2025-08-21

### Analysis & Verification
- **Codebase Analysis**: Comprehensive review of existing directions implementation
- **Status Verification**: Confirmed lightweight directions system implemented but not functional due to bug
- **Feature Validation**: Identified state timing bug preventing route point creation
- **Production Issue**: Directions system not working despite being implemented
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Updated project memory with latest session progress and findings

### Backup & Version Management
- Created versioned snapshot v0.2.0-stable with comprehensive annotations
- Generated repository backup: `backups/repo-v0.2.0-stable.tgz`
- Generated build backup: `backups/build-v0.2.0-stable.tgz`
- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation with session findings

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2025-08-17

### Added
- **Comprehensive Favicon System**: Complete icon support with 8 sizes, Apple touch icons, social media optimization
- **Lightweight Directions Implementation**: Click-to-route navigation with A→B→C waypoint sequence
- **Floating Directions Toolbar**: Clear/Undo/Route controls with mobile-friendly design
- **Custom Markers**: A-Z labeled markers with color progression (green→orange→red)

### Technical Implementation
- Routes Library Integration: Added 'routes' to LIBRARIES array for DirectionsService
- Custom Click Semantics: Direction points only accepted in Map Mode inside bounds
- Route Preservation: All existing viewport constraints maintained with `preserveViewport: true`
- Enhanced existing click handler instead of replacing (seamless integration)

### Infrastructure
- **Versioned Snapshot Management**: Protected release branch with annotated tags and backup archives
- **Complete favicon ecosystem**: Proper HTML integration across all devices
- **Production Deployment**: All features successfully deployed
- **File Cleanup**: Removed unused files while preserving original property baseline codebase

### Build & Deployment
- Successful build verification: 595KB JS + 59KB CSS with routes libraries
- All features deployed and functional in production
- Favicon support across all devices and browsers
- Directions system working with preserved constraints

## [1.0-property-map] - 2025-08-15

### Baseline
- Original Property Heatmap application preserved as baseline
- Complete backup branch and tag for future rollback capability
- Full property placement functionality maintained
